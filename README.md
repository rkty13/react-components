# react-components

Personal project for a UI framework using React. The most common UI components will be included in this library. And yes, I need a better name for this.

## Goals

* **Customizable**: Style definitions should be easy to override, and functionality should consider most use-cases.
* **Mobile first**: Components should look good on all screen sizes.
* **Accessible**: Components should be accessible to those with disabilities.
* **Modern**: Because screw IE.
